/**
 * Verify that a trace recorded against a *real device* contains real data.
 *
 * The SDK unit suite covers the archive end to end
 * (`packages/tapsmith/src/__tests__/trace-archive-contents.test.ts`), but every
 * capture there comes from a mocked gRPC client. Nothing checked that a trace
 * produced by an actual emulator/simulator holds decodable screenshots at the
 * device's real resolution, a hierarchy snapshot that actually contains the
 * element its action targeted, or the app's genuine HTTPS traffic. Those are
 * the failures a mock cannot reproduce, and they were invisible to the device
 * E2E suite, which records `retain-on-failure` traces nobody ever opens.
 *
 * This drives one existing E2E test with tracing forced on, then reads the
 * archive it produced and checks it. Everything it asserts is derived from the
 * archive itself — the selectors the steps recorded, the screenshot dimensions
 * the device reported — so it stays correct if the test it drives is edited.
 * The checks live in `utils/trace-archive-checks.mjs` and are unit-tested.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node verify-trace-archive.mjs -c tapsmith.config.android-ci.mjs [--device SERIAL]
 *   node verify-trace-archive.mjs --verify-only path/to/trace.zip
 *
 * Other arguments are passed through to `tapsmith test`. `--verify-only` skips
 * the run and re-checks an archive that already exists, which is how a CI
 * failure is reproduced from the uploaded artifact.

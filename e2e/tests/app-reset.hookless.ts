/**
 * The reset ladder against a build WITHOUT the in-app hooks — the
 * out-of-the-box path every app is on before it integrates
 * `@tapsmith/react-native`. Detection must come up empty, warm requests must
 * fall back honestly, and plain deep links must settle through the
 * resumed-activity heuristic (there is no nav counter to acknowledge them).
 *
 * Deliberately NOT named `*.test.ts`: every regular config globs that, and
 * these assertions are wrong for a hooked build. Only
 * `tapsmith.config.android-ci-hookless.mjs` matches this file, run by
 * `.github/workflows/e2e-android-hookless.yml` against an APK built without
 * `EXPO_PUBLIC_TAPSMITH_HOOKS`.

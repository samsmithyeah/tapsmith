/**
 * Regression: the agent must resolve and act on visible elements even when the
 * screen never goes idle.
 *
 * The Animating screen runs a continuous JS-driven animation plus an
 * indeterminate spinner, so the accessibility-event stream never quiets.
 * Before the WaitEngine fix, the Android agent gated element resolution on
 * UiAutomator global idle, so every query blocked for its full timeout and the
 * daemon's per-command deadline fired ("Agent command timed out after 5.5s")
 * even though the targets below are fully visible. These assertions should now
 * complete promptly.

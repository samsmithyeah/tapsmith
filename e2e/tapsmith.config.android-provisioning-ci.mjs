// The emulator-managed setup docs/ci-setup.md documents ("Parallel Workers"):
// `avd` + `launchEmulators: true` and more than one worker, on a runner where
// NO emulator is running beforehand — so Tapsmith has to launch every device
// itself (provisionEmulators: -read-only instances of one AVD, port picking,
// the CI boot wait, health and stability probes). The sharded suites pre-boot
// their emulator in the workflow and only ever exercise adoption.
//
// Run by .github/workflows/e2e-provisioning.yml, which checks the host before
// and after (verify-provisioning.mjs) so a pre-booted or untracked emulator
// fails the job even when every test passes. A few small files are enough:
// this lane tests the launch path, not the app.

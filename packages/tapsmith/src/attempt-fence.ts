// ─── Test-attempt fence ───
//
// A test body that hits the runner's safety timeout cannot be cancelled —
// `Promise.race` only abandons the promise, the async function keeps
// executing. Left unfenced, that "zombie" body keeps driving the shared
// device while the next attempt (or the next test) is already running:
// its taps land mid-retry, its trace events pollute the new attempt's
// collector, and state-mutating calls (saveAppState) race the retry's
// setup. Seen in the wild: a timed-out auth setup saved app state while
// its retry was mid `launchApp({ clearData: true })`.
//
// The fence gives each attempt an AsyncLocalStorage token. The runner
// closes the token as soon as the attempt settles; any device RPC issued
// from that attempt's async context afterwards rejects immediately with
// TestEndedError, and trace writes from it are dropped. Runner code, hooks,
// and later attempts run outside the token (or under a fresh one) and are
// unaffected.

 * failures go — main's `Error: …`, argument errors, panics — while its
 * tracing goes to stdout, which stays discarded. Not a pipe: the daemon, and
 * every process it starts with inherited stdio, would get EPIPE once nothing
 * reads the pipe, and an unread pipe that fills blocks them outright.
 *
 * The temporary file is removed by `dispose()` once the start is judged. A

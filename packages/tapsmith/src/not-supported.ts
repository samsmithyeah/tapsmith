/**
 * Runtime stand-ins for Playwright APIs Tapsmith does not implement (yet).
 *
 * Playwright users call these by reflex. Without a stand-in the call fails as
 * "import_tapsmith.test.step is not a function" — a bundler-mangled TypeError
 * that names neither the API nor what to do instead (PILOT-544). The stand-ins
 * are deliberately left off the TypeScript types, so the type checker still
 * reports the property as missing; they only make the runtime failure clear.
 * Each is replaced by the real API when it lands.

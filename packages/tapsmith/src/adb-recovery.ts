/**
 * The pre-run health check for a pinned Android device, and what it does when
 * the device does not answer (PILOT-475).
 *
 * The ADB server is shared by every adb client on the machine: other Tapsmith
 * sessions and their daemons' forwarded agent sockets, Android Studio,
 * logcat, scrcpy. Restarting it (`adb kill-server`) drops all of them, so the
 * recovery tries the targeted fixes first and restarts the server only as a
 * last resort, only when no other Tapsmith session holds an Android device,
 * and says so when it does:
 *
 * 1. a pinned serial adb does not list fails at once — no restart brings back
 *    a device that is not there;
 * 2. a slow reply is not a dead device: one patient `echo` before any
 *    recovery, so a loaded host does not set it off;
 * 3. `adb -s <serial> reconnect` kicks only this device's transport;
 * 4. the server restart, unless another live session holds an Android device.

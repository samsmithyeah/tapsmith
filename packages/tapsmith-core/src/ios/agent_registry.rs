//! Lifetime of the `xcodebuild test-without-building` agent processes this
//! daemon spawns (PILOT-299).
//!
//! An iOS agent is an `xcodebuild` child of the daemon. Nothing used to stop
//! it when the daemon went away, so every session left one behind, reparented
//! to launchd, squatting its simulator for days. Two mechanisms fix that:
//!
//! 1. **In-process registry.** Every agent is registered the moment it is
//!    spawned (not when it becomes ready, so a shutdown during the startup
//!    wait catches it too) and deregistered once it has been reaped. On a
//!    graceful shutdown — SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGHUP, or the daemon's parent
//!    dying — [`shutdown_all`] stops every registered agent and refuses new
//!    spawns, so a startup loop that sees its xcodebuild exit cannot relaunch
//!    it behind our back.
//! 2. **Owner records + startup reaper.** A daemon that is SIGKILLed runs no
//!    code, so each agent also gets an owner record in
//!    `~/.tapsmith/ios-agents/<pid>.json` naming the agent and the daemon
//!    that started it, each by pid *and* process start time. The next daemon
//!    to start on the machine ([`reap_orphans`]) stops an agent only when its
//!    record says so: the recorded daemon is gone and the recorded process is
//!    still the one we started. An xcodebuild without a record is never
//!    touched — Tapsmith cannot prove it launched it (the PILOT-401 rule).

//! Continuous screen-recording dispatcher (PILOT-114).
//!
//! Mirrors `crate::screenshot`'s platform-dispatch shape: a `start` that
//! returns an owned `RecordingHandle`, and a `stop` that consumes the handle
//! and returns the path to the finalised MP4 on the host filesystem.
//!
//! Platform routing:
//! - Android → `adb shell screenrecord` (3-min hard cap per segment; see
//!   the warning in `stop`).
//! - iOS simulator → `xcrun simctl io recordVideo --codec h264`.
//! - iOS physical → `ffmpeg -f avfoundation`. Requires ffmpeg on PATH.

/**
 * Serves one daemon connection: newline-delimited JSON requests in, one
 * response line per request out, one command at a time and in order.
 *
 * Each command runs on a thread of its own from [executor] while this
 * connection's thread goes on reading (PILOT-605). The daemon sends the next
 * request only after the answer to the last one, so what that read sees
 * while a command runs is the daemon dropping the connection — it has given
 * up on the command — and the command's [CommandCancellation] is cancelled,
 * so its long-running loops stop at their next checkpoint instead of running
 * on (and touching the screen) after nobody waits for them. A request that
 * does arrive early waits for the one before it.
 *
 * [serve] returns as soon as the connection closes, without waiting for a
 * cancelled command to reach a checkpoint: it may be stuck in a native call
 * that cannot be stopped, and the caller frees the connection's resources.
 * Plain JVM code with an injected logger, for the unit tests.
